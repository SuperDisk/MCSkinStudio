# MCSkinStudio
Minecraft Skin Editor in Python

MCSkinStudio (originally called MCSkin2D as a parody of MCSkin3D) was an old project I did when I was about 14 or 15. It's a Minecraft skin editor created with Python and Pygame, and was probably the first project to feature the early "game engine" that evolved into MegaCity. The code is total garbage but it's one of my first projects so I'm still sort of proud of it.
